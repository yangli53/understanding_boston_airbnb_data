# Understanding Boston Airbnb Data #

## Project Motivation ##

Before moving to Boston, I used to lease the guest suites of my house on Airbnb. I enjoyed being a host and a superhost. Although I am not ready to purchase a property in Boston yet (due to high sale price), I would like to know the market well and keep an eye on the neighborhoods that have good rent value on Airbnb. Based on my experience, these are also good tips for new hosts.

I will address the following three questions:
1. Which neighborhood is most popular? Which neighborhood is most expensive?
2. Which features of the property influence the price most?
3. Which aspect of the property do guests care the most according to their ratings?

## Dataset Description ##

The dataset I used comes from insideairbnb.com. This is a non-commercial website that provides scraped Airbnb listings, reviews and calendar data from major cities around the world. People can use the data to understand how Airbnb is being used in these cities.

I used the listings data scraped on Sept 22, 2019. It contains details of all the listings in Boston including price, property information, host information, ratings, etc. There were 5711 active listings by this date.

## Findings ##

I summarize my findings in a blog post [here](https://medium.com/@fivecentsly/3-things-you-should-know-before-leasing-your-bostons-property-on-airbnb-10594cf1043b).
