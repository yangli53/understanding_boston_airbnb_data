# Understanding Boston Airbnb Data #

## Dataset Description  ##

The dataset used for this project comes from insideairbnb.com. This is a non-commercial website that provides scraped Airbnb listings, 
reviews and calendar data from major cities around the world. People can use the free to download data to understand how Airbnb is really 
being used in cities. 

I used the linstings data scraped on Sept 22 2019. It contains details of all the listings in Boston including price, property information,
host information, ratings, etc. There are 5711 active listings by this date.

## Project Motivation ##

I used to be a superhost on Airbnb before moving to Boston. I want to learn the trends of Airbnb in Boston area and seek a property that
may have a good value on Airbnb. I will address the following three questions:

1. Which neighbourhood has the highest average price? Is it also the most popular neighbourhood?
2. Which features of the property influence the price most?
3. Which aspect of the property do guests care the most according to their ratings?
