# Understanding Boston Airbnb Data #

## Project Motivation ##

I used to be a superhost on Airbnb just by occasionally leasing my house. I also have great experience with Airbnb as a guest. After moving to Boston, I want to learn the trends of local Airbnb and seek potential opportunies to be a host again. I will address the following three questions:

1. Which neighborhood is most expensive? Which neighborhood is most popular?
2. Which features of the property influence the price most?
3. Which aspect of the property do guests care the most according to their ratings?

## Dataset Description ##

The dataset I used comes from insideairbnb.com. This is a non-commercial website that provides scraped Airbnb listings, reviews and calendar data from major cities around the world. People can use the data to understand how Airbnb is being used in these cities.

I used the listings data scraped on Sept 22, 2019. It contains details of all the listings in Boston including price, property information, host information, ratings, etc. There were 5711 active listings by this date.
